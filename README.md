# Real Analysis

This repository provides a structured introduction to real analysis, including foundational concepts, theorems, and illustrative Python scripts.

## Directory Structure

- `real-numbers/` — Properties and structure of the real number system
- `sequences-series/` — Sequences, series, convergence, and divergence
- `limits-continuity/` — Limits, continuity, and their foundational role
- `differentiation/` — Theory of differentiation and applications
- `integration/` — Riemann integration and the fundamental theorem of calculus
- `metric-topology/` — Metric spaces, open/closed sets, compactness, and topology

Each subdirectory contains a README and example Python scripts demonstrating key concepts.

## Getting Started

To run the example scripts, ensure you have Python 3 and the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

Then run any script, for example:

```bash
python sequences-series/convergent_sequence_example.py
```
